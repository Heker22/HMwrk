    <h1>The German Sheperd</h1>
    <p><span>The German Shepherd[a], also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.

        It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.[2]</span></p>

They are wonderful with all types of people and great around children. This is why they are a top choice among families all around the world. Their fluffy coats and loving personalities make them the perfect companion for snuggling and cuddling. Keep in mind; they can be somewhat aloof and aggressive with strangers.</p>
        </li>

<li><h2>Courage:</h2>
    <p>German Shepherds are incredibly courageous and will take action when the time comes without batting an eye. They will do whatever it takes to protect their owner or family. Their courage originates from breeding back in Germany to defend sheep from threatening prey. This carried on through their genes and remains to this day a part of who they are. They will take on animal or human to protect the ones they love. In 2016, a two-year-old German Shepherd named “Haus” saved the life of a seven-year-old girl from a Diamondback Rattlesnake by jumping in front of the girl and taking the bite.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Intelligence:</h2>
    <p>German Shepherds are extremely intelligent and known for being one of the smartest dogs in the world. This is the reason they are so popular among families and law enforcement. They have the ability to perform and remember several tasks. They are the third smartest dog breed and very easy to teach new commands. To earn this title, they received testing against other breeds. The requirement was to learn a new command after five repetitions and to follow the very first command presented to them ninety five percent of the time. They are also considered as smart as a two year old child.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Loyalty:</h2>
    <p>This is one of the top amazing German Shepherd qualities. Their loyalty is unwavering and they will fall on the sword to stand by their owner or family. This is what makes them such excellent guard dogs. One owner referred to him and his wife’s German Shepherd “Rusty” as “breathtaking”. The dog was completely devoted to his wife who was in a wheelchair and would stay by her side at all times to protect her. The dog refused to leave her side when she was sick and couldn’t get out of bed.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Power and Athleticism:</h2>
    <p>German shepherds are extremely athletic and powerful animals. They are very agile and muscular which is another reason they are so sought after for many different jobs and occupations. Although they are large, they are able to sustain high speeds and don’t tire easily.</p>
